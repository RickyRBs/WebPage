                This skateboard was a significant part of Bruno's high school memories. Every day, he would take his board to school, using it as his daily companion. It became a symbol of that time in his life, filled with carefree moments and adventures. However, during the COVID pandemic, the board was neglected and eventually rotted away. With its decay, a piece of his past faded too. And just like that, it was time to say goodbye to a cherished memory.
