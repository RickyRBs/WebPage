            <p>
                For this project, I initially started with the idea of creating a very basic clock. Later, I decided to take it a step further and experiment with using clouds, airplanes, and cars to represent hours, minutes, and seconds. However, challenges arose when I realized that in order to make this work, I needed to control their generation within a specific range, as well as their position, shape, and size. This turned out to be a complicated issue.
            </p>
            <p>
                I then moved on to my second idea, which was to add artistic elements to a basic clock design. Midway through, I was inspired by the Earth-Moon system and wondered if I could use the Sun as the center, with other planets representing the hour hand, Earth as the minute hand, and the Moon as the second hand. I initially envisioned the Moon rotating around the Earth, but I soon realized that this concept was too complex and would take a lot of time and effort to implement with my current skills, so I decided to abandon it.

            <p>
                In the final design, the background was originally more elaborate with a detailed starry sky, but I felt it was too distracting and would affect the readability of the time. I therefore opted to fix the background after generating it randomly, keeping it in the distance. I also added a day-night background transition and adjusted the colors of the clock hands, making it easier for users to read the time.
            </p>
            <p>
                At one point, I considered placing a digital clock in the center of the Sun so that users could instantly see the time while still enjoying the artistic design. However, I found that this compromised the overall aesthetic, and I may explore other ways to incorporate this feature in the future.
