            <p>
                Through tracking this habit, I learned that I stick to routines more than I realized, especially when it comes to gaming. Playing the same mobile game over and over feels safe and familiar, but it also showed me how easy it is for me to avoid trying new things, even when I know they could benefit me as a game design student. It made me question whether this habit is helping me relax or just holding me back from growing in other areas.

                When it comes to visualizing this data, I realized how simplifying something complicated, like my gaming habit, can make it clearer to understand. The process of turning my behavior into a visual pattern helped me see it from a new perspective. I gained insight into the repetitive nature of my gaming, but at the same time, I lost some of the emotional side of it. The visual doesn’t capture how playing that game makes me feel, like the comfort or the frustration that comes with sticking to it for so long.
